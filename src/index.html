                <h3>Podotia's history</h3>
                <p>
                    Originally, civilization started on the planet of Lomi, also known by its exoplanet designation, K3d.
                    The Kingdom of Podotia was founded in the northwest of Lomi, on a continent called Argumentland, in the year 1156 as the successor to a previous country known as the Duchy of Tfaiktali.
                    However, a series of events led to the explosion of Lomi in 1818.
                    Because of that, the various countries of Lomi all scrambled to establish colonies on other planets, even some which are outside of the K3 star system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Podotia, in particular, established its main colony on the planet of Norlat, also known as K3e, meaning it was orbiting K3 like Lomi, but was a bit further away.
                    Norlat is very cold, with most of the ground being ice. Meanwhile, there are some lakes near the equator, but they are partially ice instead of being entirely ice due to a mysterious substance dissolved in the water.
                    Since anywhere except the equator was unbearably cold, the ~5 countries that settled on Norlat were all on the equator.
                    Podotia initially established 3 "camps": Scelvzej, Ketehel, and Vlastif. The capital was then moved to Fleketso, named after the king at the time, Flekets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, Ome's (Marlulos), JJ's (José City), Smart's (New Perken), and Jaebom's (Nórawkaló) cities are all from the same universe as Floattown.
                    There are connections, such as the fact that Ome's video mentions that Marlulos was established by Polusian spacefarers, while the country of Polusie was actually Podotia's fierce enemy back on Lomi.
                </p>
                <h3>Kadisc's history</h3>
                <p>
                    Kadisc Letempyl (/ka.disɕ le.tem.paɪl/) was born on 12 June 1789.
                    Born into a middle class family, he studied economics, but dropped out at the age of only 16.
                    The next year, while he was 17, he founded a textile company, Kadi Rtc., which earned him a large amount of wealth.
                    With this wealth, during Armageddon, he managed to get himself a private spaceship be able to travel to Norlat by himself without having to cram in with all the others on the government-funded public spaceships.
                    He settled in Scelvzej, but found it "too boring".
                </p>
                <h3>Establishment of Floattown</h3>
                <p>
                    Floattown was established on 11 May 1832 by Kadisc Letempyl.
                    It was geographically unique as, while the existing cities were situated on ice, Floattown was the first, and only, to be floating on top of one of the lakes, giving it its name.
                    Another thing unique about Floattown is that unlike the other Podotian settlements, Floattown primarily used English as its official language.
                    In fact, the Podotian name for Floattown is different, being Flóttaun (/'flɔ:t.taun/).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kadisc immediately got to hiring various contractors to build things.
                    The first few things to be built were the central area, library, and seafood market.
                </p>
                <h3>Expansion</h3>
                <p>
                    Later, Kadisc also got the Podotian public services to get into the city, including the police, fire rescue, and legal system.
                    The problem is that the fire rescue was actually really useless, because due to Norlat's oxygen-poor atmosphere and cold temperatures, fire never spontaneously started on their own.
                    To fix this, Kadisc commissioned a "fire ignition department" to give the fire department an actual job.
                    As for the police, there was also a problem, as they were extremely corrupt to the point that they build a separate place for accepting bribes as the main police station was being filled with people trying to bribe the officers every day, and they accepted every single one of those bribes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actual businesses and companies entered the city, including One Page News with its headquarters building and an IKEA in the south of the city.
                    The triplet towers were also built.
                    Before stepping down as mayor, Kadisc commissioned a giant fan too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite being called a "city", Floattown is presently more like a simple village or town and there are only about 7 residents.

                <h2>Statistics</h2>
                <p>
                    Floattown has a total of <b>x</b> lego bricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I were to buy the bricks to actually build Floattown, it'd be <b>x</b> dollars or <b>x</b> baht.
                    However, many of the pieces actually don't exist (for example, there is no very light gray 1x4 plate, but Floattown uses them to line the canals).
                    But if I somehow got those pieces, it'd take around <b>x</b> hours to build.
