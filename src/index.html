                <p>
                    About 10 years ago in the year 1802, land prices in the <a href="https://wiki.anpang.lol/rp3/Podotia">Kingdom of Podotia</a> had gotten so high that the government approved cities to be built on water.
                    One of the first floating cities to pop up was <i>Flijto</i>, founded and funded by entrepeneur Kadisc Letempyl.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                    Podotia is on the planet of <a href="https://wiki.anpang.lol/rp3/Lomi">Lomi</a>, which has a lot more countries like Verkes, Shezhland, etc.
                    In fact, Ome's (Marlulos), JJ's (Jose City), Smart's (Perken), and Jaebom's (Nórawkaló) cities are also located on Lomi.
                    But while Marlulos is in Roblox, Flijto is entirely in lego.
                    The official language of Podotia is <a href="https://podo.anpang.lol/">Podotian</a>, but English is used in Flijto.

                <h2>Statistics</h2>
                <p>
                    Flijto has a total of <b>x</b> lego bricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I were to buy the bricks to actually build Flijto, it'd be <b>x</b> dollars or <b>x</b> baht.
                    However, many of the pieces actually don't exist (for example, there is no very light gray 1x4 plate, but Flijto uses them to line the canals).
                    But if I somehow got those pieces, it'd take around <b>x</b> hours to build.
