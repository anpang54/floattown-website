                <p>
                    About 10 years ago in the year 1802, land prices in the <a href="https://wiki.anpang.lol/rp3/Podotia">Kingdom of Podotia</a> had gotten so high that the government approved cities to be built on water.
                    One of the first floating cities to pop up was <i>Floattown</i>, founded and funded by entrepeneur Kadisc Letempyl.
                </p>
                </p>
                    Podotia is on the planet of <a href="https://wiki.anpang.lol/rp3/Lomi">Lomi</a>, which has several other countries like Verkes, Shezhland, etc.
                    In fact, Ome's (Marlulos), JJ's (Jose City), Smart's (New Perken), and Jaebom's (Nórawkaló) cities are also located on Lomi.
                    But Ome made Marlulos in Roblox Studio, Floattown is entirely in lego.
                    Although the official language of Podotia is <a href="https://podo.anpang.lol/">Podotian</a>, English is used in Floattown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the lego city and this website were entirely created myself.

                I added myself and 9 of my friends into this city.

                <p>
                    About 10 years ago, land prices in the Kingdom of Podotia had gotten so high that the government approved cities to be built on water.

                <h2>Statistics</h2>
                <p>
                    Floattown has a total of <b>x</b> lego bricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I were to buy the bricks to actually build Floattown, it'd be <b>x</b> dollars or <b>x</b> baht.
                    However, many of the pieces actually don't exist (for example, there is no very light gray 1x4 plate, but Floattown uses them to line the canals).
                    But if I somehow got those pieces, it'd take around <b>x</b> hours to build.
