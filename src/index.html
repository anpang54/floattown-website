                    Floattown is my (Anpang 21/352) submission for the city project.
                    <br>
                    It's a city built with lego which is on an icy planet named Norlat.

                        The Floattown police were so corrupt that the main police station was constantly filled by people bribing them. To fix this, they commissioned a separate open-air area solely for the purpose of letting people come in a bribe officers. Annoyingly, the number of people bribing officers mysteriously decreased right after this area was constructed.

Now, those sea organisms are being farmed in labs and sold at exorbitant prices.

                <h3>Podotia's history</h3>
                <p>
                    Originally, civilization started on the planet of Lomi, also known by its exoplanet designation, K3d.
                    The Kingdom of Podotia was founded in the northwest of Lomi, on a continent called Argumentland, in the year 1156 as the successor to a previous country known as the Duchy of Tfaiktali.
                    However, a series of events led to the explosion of Lomi in 1818.
                    Because of that, the various countries of Lomi all scrambled to establish colonies on other planets, even some which are outside of the K3 star system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Podotia, in particular, established its main colony on the planet of Norlat, also known as K3e, meaning it was orbiting K3 like Lomi, but was a bit further away.
                    Norlat is very cold, with most of the ground being ice. Meanwhile, there are some lakes near the equator, but they are partially ice instead of being entirely ice or entirely water due to a mysterious substance dissolved in the water.
                    Since anywhere except the equator was unbearably cold, the ~5 countries that settled on Norlat were all on the equator.
                    Podotia initially established 3 "camps": Scelvzej, Ketehel, and Vlastif. The capital was then moved to Fleketso, named after the king at the time, Flekets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, Ome's (Marlulos), JJ's (José City), Smart's (New Perken), and Jaebom's (Nórawkaló) cities are all from the same universe as Floattown.
                    There are connections, such as the fact that Ome's video mentions that Marlulos was established by Polusian spacefarers, while the country of Polusie was actually Podotia's fierce enemy back on Lomi.
                </p>
                <h3>Kadisc's history</h3>
                <p>
                    Kadisc Letempyl (/ka.disɕ le.tem.paɪl/) was born on 12 June 1789.
                    Born into a middle class family, he studied economics, but dropped out at the age of only 16.
                    The next year, while he was 17, he founded a textile company, Kadi Rtc., which earned him a large amount of wealth.
                    With this wealth, during Armageddon, he managed to get himself a private spaceship be able to travel to Norlat by himself without having to cram in with all the others on the government-funded public spaceships.
                    He settled in Scelvzej, but found it "too boring", so he tried to make his own city.
                </p>
                <h3>Establishment of Floattown</h3>
                <p>
                    Floattown was established on 11 May 1832 by Kadisc Letempyl.
                    It was geographically unique as, while the existing cities were situated on ice, Floattown was the first, and only, to be floating on top of one of the lakes, giving it its name.
                    Another thing unique about Floattown is that unlike the other Podotian settlements, Floattown primarily used English as its official language.
                    In fact, the Podotian name for Floattown is different, being Flóttaun (/'flɔ:t.taun/).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kadisc immediately got to hiring various contractors to build things.
                    The first few things to be built were the central area, library, and seafood market.
                    Kadisc also commissioned an electric car company to build custom-made vehicles which could run on the half-ice canals and ground of Floattown.
                </p>
                <h3>Expansion</h3>
                <p>
                    Later, Kadisc also got the Podotian public services to get into the city, including the police, fire rescue, and legal system.
                    The problem is that the fire rescue was actually really useless, because due to Norlat's oxygen-poor atmosphere and cold temperatures, fire never spontaneously started on their own.
                    To fix this, Kadisc commissioned a "fire ignition department" to give the fire department an actual job, and so that he could watch extinguishing fires for his own enjoyment (he was very evil).
                    As for the police, there was also a problem, as they were extremely corrupt to the point that they build a separate place for accepting bribes as the main police station was being filled with people trying to bribe the officers every day, and they accepted every single one of those bribes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actual businesses and companies entered the city, including One Page News with its headquarters building and an IKEA in the south of the city.
                    The triplet towers were also built, and a famous druglord from "Cracked Up Land" established the Triangular Prism Pharmacy which, despite the name, sells illegal drugs instead of legal ones.
                    Kadisc, being as evil as he is, actually welcomed the illegal drugstore.
                    Before stepping down as mayor, he also commissioned a giant fan in the northwest of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The government later set up a legal municipality (the 3rd-level administrative subdivision in Podotia) which encompassed Floattown and some surrounding areas.
                    This resulted in the construction of the municipal office, meaning any residents could easily access government services without having to go anywhere.
                    Despite being called a "city", Floattown is presently more like a simple village or town and there are only about 7 residents.
